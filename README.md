# ML_clinical_data
This repository includes ML algorithms to classify different types of clinical data, such as cognitive scores or biochemical parameters.

## Links to the notebooks
  * [ML classifiers for cognitive decline](https://github.com/mirentamayoelizalde/ML_clinical_data/blob/main/cogntive_decline_classification.ipynb)
      - Explores different demographics data and cognitive scores from over 270 patients, and evaluates several common ML models to classify them into showing/not showing cognitive decline. Further, the most relevant features for each model are selected.
  * [Multidimensional data visualisation and classification](https://github.com/mirentamayoelizalde/ML_clinical_data/blob/main/multidimensional_analysis_parallel_plots.ipynb)
      - Explores correlations between the different features from 80 participants and uses parallel coordinates to visualise and classify multidimensional data
